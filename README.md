## EIP Improvement Process

### Purpose
The EIPIP meeting is a regularly-scheduled process improvement meeting intended to bring together experienced developers and experts to facilitate the [Ethereum Improvement Proposal](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs) improvement process.

### Issues
If you have an issue related to EIP that you would like to be discussed and aren't sure of the best place to file it, feel free to use the [Issues tab of this repository](https://github.com/ethereum-cat-herders/EIPIP/issues). The Ethereum Cat Herders will review it and bring it up in a meeting if needed.
