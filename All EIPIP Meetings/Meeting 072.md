# 1. Discuss Open Issues/PRs, and other topics

Video | [0:00](https://youtube.com/watch?v=4zYiDQmi9gA&si=EnSIkaIECMiOmarE)
-|-

This is a carry over from last meeting, as last meeting was cancelled due to holidays.

## What are the prerequisites for someone to be considered a viable reviewer?

Any documentation/resources? Process of assigning Peer Reviewer
for community reference?

Might be related to the concept of peer reviewing. Unsure where this concept came from. It may have came from Sam. Unfortunately, Sam is not here this meeting.

## Should we make the markdown linter required?

- https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/pull/5508

Lightclient and Victor think it's ok to merge. The linter rules seem reasonable. 

- https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/pull/5270

Decided to wait until Sam for a decision on this PR.

## Actions

- 72.1 - Continue discussion on Peer Reviews
- 72.2 - Waiting on Sam decision on https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/pull/5270

## Decisions

- 72.1 - Ok to merge https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/pull/5508.

[Update EIP-2565: Update Spec ethereum/EIPs#5240](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/pull/5240). Skipped as its changed to draft.


[Update EIP-20: Renovate to fit most current EIP-1 recommendations ethereum/EIPs#6038](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/pull/6038). Decision was not to change an EIP as prominent as EIP-20.

[Update EIP-3475: Changing comments ethereum/EIPs#5789](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/pull/5270). Not discussed here. 


Some discussion around PR about EVM equivalence. The PR: https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/pull/5757. It was about adding execution spec to EIP-1. The EVM equivalence should just be an informational EIP. 

Can discuss again when Sam is around.

Some discussion from Victor was left on the Agenda. These were thoughts on Peer-review process. Can wait until Sam is on the call.

Another EIP: https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/pull/6306. To update EIP-1 with permitted links. Lightclient doesn't want to add the Yellow Paper, but is ok with adding the execution specs. Victor has no objections.

- 72.3 - Approval on https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/pull/6306

[Recording Meeting 9](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5JIwKQeN1LU)
[Agenda Meeting 10](https://github.com/ethereum-cat-herders/EIPIP/issues/204)

Did have a meeting. Tried to cover all the PRs listed there. However, a few which still need to be covered this week. Hopefully, covered before next meeting.

Meeting and agenda for next meeting is available.

There was a topic about having a meeting on the weekend, as some can't attend. Lightclient will most likely not attend. 

Victor can do both, and is supportive of supporting more timezones and availability. Victor can do 1 offs. But also wants to be consious of people's time off.

Pooja would rather have it on weekdays. Pooja is in support of having a fixed time. Can have an off-scheduled meeting if needed. 

14:00 UTC seems to be the most compatible across the world.

Decision is to have the next meeting on the 25th.

## Decisions

- 72.4 - Have next meeting normal time

# 6. Review action items from earlier meetings

## Actions

- 72.4 - Continue collecting feedback on straw man proposal.
